# Writing and mumblings

I don't focus on maintaining high writing quality; instead, I prioritize writing frequently.
Goal is to maximize the number of words written per month, with the hope that eventually, impressions and impact will align.
Also, I create shorts learnings in [TILs][til] and [ML Nuggets][ml_nugget] and hope to put long form writing here.


Sometimes I also write paper summaries, and I'm exploring how to share them. Keep an eye out for that...
I hope you find something valuable.
