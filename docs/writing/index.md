# Writing and mumblings

I don't focus on maintaining high writing quality; instead, I prioritize writing frequently. My goal is to maximize the number of words written per month, with the hope that eventually, impressions and impact will align. Some of these links will be videos, some will be tweets, and some will be blog posts. I hope you find something valuable.
