# Freediving under ice

Growing up, I wasn't very physically active. However, as I got older and had more time, I made a conscious effort to get in shape and improve my relationship with my body. During the Covid pandemic, I developed RSI and my thumbs from coding too much, which prevented me from participating in any sports.

Determined to stay active, I turned to swimming and found myself particularly drawn to the breath-hold aspect of the sport. With some training and certifications under my belt, I was eventually invited to take part in an ice dive in Canada. It was a surreal and thrilling experience, with the freezing water and the sound of my heartbeat in my ears as I descended deeper and deeper.

Free diving has become an integral part of my life, providing me with a sense of freedom and exploration that I never thought possible. It has allowed me to push myself both physically and mentally, and has given me a deeper appreciation for the ocean and its inhabitants.
